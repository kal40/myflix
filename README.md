# MyFlix Client side application

## Description

The client-side component of the MyFlix application using REACT. A single-page, responsive app with routing, rich interactions, several interface views, and a polished user experience. It will support the existing [server-side API](https://myflixapi.smartcoder.dev/) by facilitating user requests and rendering the response from the server-side via a number of different interface views.

The main purpose of this app is to present how I create the frontend in React of a fullstack application.

This site was built using [Netlify Build](https://www.netlify.com/products/build/).
